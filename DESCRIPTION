Description: Provides tools that support relative importance analysis focusing 
    on dominance analysis.  Dominance analysis is a methodology for 
    determining the relative importance of predictors/features/independent v
    ariables as well as parameter estimates.  These tools are intended to  
    extend relative importance analysis to, effectively, any statistical or 
    machine learning function as defined or desired by the user-especially
    those where the user wants to use custom importance metric or modeling 
    function.
